    <p>The <a href="https://www.reanimationlibrary.org/" target="_blank">Reanimation Library</a> is an independent
        presence library.* The books in the collection—simultaneously prosaic and peculiar—are relics of the rapidly
        receding 20th century. Chosen primarily for the images that they contain, they have been culled from thrift
        stores, rummage sales, flea markets, municipal dumps, library sales, give-away piles, and used bookstores across
        the country.</p>

    <p>Over time, libraries have enjoyed a special privilege of determining which published materials are deemed
        culturally valuable and worth preserving. Materials that are kept within a collection are largely considered to
        be more useful than those that are removed. Books and other materials are removed from collections for a variety
        of different reasons: space is in short supply, materials become physically worn, information becomes outdated,
        and new editions are produced. Whatever the ultimate (and presumably sound) motivation for weeding a collection
        may be, one result is that a tremendous amount of printed material disappears from the public realm once it
        leaves the public library.
    </p>
    <p>The Reanimation Library is particularly interested in the loss of visual information that accompanies the process
        of weeding. Collection development policies generally assign little weight to the visual dimension of a work,
        unless that work happens to be graphically driven (i.e. a book profiling a visual artist, graphic design, or
        similar materials of an explicitly visual nature). Most library collection development policies prioritize the
        acquisition of items that contain currently relevant textual information, and replace items where that
        information is lacking or out of date. This protocol, coupled with the continual production of newer editions,
        creates a growing fossil record of outdated books—a veritable feast for image archaeologists. The Reanimation
        Library is actively engaged in building a collection of materials that are rich in visual information regardless
        of the currency of their textual content. The library serves as a repository and, more pertinently, an access
        point for such materials.
    </p>
    <p>Artists, historians, writers, musicians, and scholars ground their creative and intellectual work in the images,
        ideas, words, and sounds of previous generations. Pastiche, collage, and sampling are fundamental tools of
        contemporary creative activity. The Reanimation Library presents a fertile environment for patrons to engage
        with the work of the past in creative, recombinant ways. Shiyali Ramamrita Ranganathan's first law of library
        science states that "books are for use." The Reanimation Library believes that a book's intended use is not its
        only use and encourages visitors to find—and share—their own uses for the books in its collection.
